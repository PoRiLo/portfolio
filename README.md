Examples of code written by me to be used as portfolio

The following projects are added as example of my coding practice:

* Find_It_Game - Interactive game over a 3D Scene built with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 

* Name_It_Game - Little interactive game created with Web Appbuilder from ESRI. It is an earlier version of Find_It, created as exercise on Web Appbuilder capabilities, modifying and creating widgets, for the GIS Online Master by ESRI (Instructions on how to deploy the app are in ~/readme.html). It is also interesting to notice the limitations of Web Appbuilder to create fully personalized web apps, while it makes the creation of out-of-the-shelf content much easier.

* PruebaFinal_API_JS - Web map created with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

* Resultados_M5_L4_U2 - Mapping web app created with ArcGIS Web Appbuilder from ESRI as exercise for the GIS Online Master by ESRI (Instructions on how to deploy the app are in ~/aplicacion/readme.html)

* AlgThink_Application4.py - An exercise from the Algorithmic Thinking subject in the Python specialization course

* AlgThink_Project4.py - The evaluation project for the Algorithmic Thinking subject. 

* RDSC_TFM_snippets.py - Python snippets used to perform several tasks for the End Of Master Project for my GIS Online Master by ESRI

* UpdateAprx_RDSC.py - Python snippets for task automation in ArcGIS, exercise from the GIS Online Master by ESRI
