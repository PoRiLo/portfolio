Small personal project to practice my ESRI ArcGIS API for JavaScript skills. Created with API version 4.17.

To deploy it, simply extract the files to a folder and open index.html in a browser.

To play, just click on the country that's prompted on the control panel. It will then highlight it and ask for another country. When player pass on a country, it applies a time penalty and brings focus on the country.
